## Overview
This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe (O/X) game designed for two players.
One player uses X and the other uses O.
The first player to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol wins the game!

## How the Program Works
The program runs a friendly O/X game that allows two players to compete against each other.
Once you press “Run”, the game starts and displays a grid where players take turns marking their moves.
- Player 1 uses X
- Player 2 uses O

## Features
- Simple and interactive interface
- Detects winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Displays the winner or a draw message

## How to Play
1- Click Run to start the game.
2- Players take turns clicking cells to place their X or O.
3- The first player to make three in a row wins!
